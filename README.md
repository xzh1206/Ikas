# Ikas

A schedule and battle statistic client of Splatoon 2 for Windows.

# Configuration

Ikas reads and parses configuration from both user.ini for user information, and config.ini for system configuration in working directory.

At this point of time, you have to configure manually.

```ini
# user.ini
[Ikas]
Cookie={Your Cookie of SplatNet}
```

```ini
# config.ini
[Ikas]
# Language is supposed to be en-US or ja-JP.
Language=ja-JP
[Network]
UseProxy=false
UseProxyHost={Your Proxy Host}
UseProxyPort={Your Proxy Port}

```
